## Research Problem

In the context of network science of small teams:

\pause

\large
\centering
What characterizes the social networks that emerge from small teams?\pause

Is there any association between how team networks are structured and their performance?\normalsize

## Research Problem (cont'd)

We are trying to answer these two questions with the following experimental data: \pause

- 42 teams typically made of 4 to 5 mixed-gender teammates.\pause

- Each team completed 1 hour of group tasks, in particular, a set of tasks to measure collective intelligence developed by MIT [@Kim2017].\pause

- We surveyed team members to capture information regarding socio-demographics **and**:\pause
    
    - Social Intelligence (SI domains): Social Perception (measured by RME), Social Accomodation, Social Gregariousness, and Social Awareness\pause 
    
    - Social Networks: Advice Seeking, Leadership, Influence (among others).

<!-- \large How can we explain what we see here? \normalsize -->

## ERGMs... the \textit{lingua franca} of SNA

- Seeks to answer the question: \emph{What local social structures gave origin to a given observed graph?}\pause

- The model is centered around a vector of \textbf{sufficient statistics} $\sufstats{}$, and is operationalized as:
  
  \begin{equation}
  	\Prcond{\Graph = \graph}{\params, \Indepvar} = \frac{%
  		\exp{\transpose{\params}\sufstats{\graph, \Indepvar}}%	
  	}{
  		\kappa\left(\params, \Indepvar\right)
  	},\quad\forall \graph\in\GRAPH\label{eq:ergm}
  \end{equation}
  
  Where $\kappa\left(\params, \Indepvar\right)$ is the normalizing constant and equals $\sum_{\graph'\in\GRAPH}\exp{\transpose{\params}\sufstats{\graph', \Indepvar}}$. \pause
  
- The set of sufficient statistics reflects social and psychological mechanisms that are hypothesized to drive the network structure. Figure \autoref{fig:ergm-structs} shows some examples of values in $\sufstats{}$.\pause
  
- In the case of directed networks, $\GRAPH$ has $2^{n(n-1)}$ terms.\pause

\large \textbf{Example of model} \normalsize


\begincols

\begincol{.4\linewidth}

In this network\linebreak

```{r simple-model, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=5, out.width='.9\\linewidth', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(13)
# x <- ergmito::rbernoulli(4)
x <- structure(c(0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), .Dim = c(4L, 
4L))
library(sna)
gplot(x, vertex.col = rgb(153, 0, 0, maxColorValue = 255))
```

\pause

We see 4 **edges**, 1 **transitive triad** and **no mutual ties**.

\endcol

\pause

\begincol{.4\linewidth}

The probability function of this model would be

\footnotesize

\begin{equation*}
\Prcond{\Graph = \graph}{\theta} = \frac{\exp{4\theta_{edges} + \theta_{ttriads} \textcolor{lightgray}{+ 0\theta_{mutual}}}}{%
\sum_{\graph'\in\GRAPH} \exp{\transpose{\theta} \sufstats{\graph'}}}
\end{equation*}

\normalsize

\noindent with $\theta = \transpose{[\theta_{edges}\quad \theta_{ttriads} \quad \theta_{mutual}]}$

\endcol

\endcols

```{r simple-model-estimates, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
estimates0 <- ergmito::ergmito(x ~ edges + ttriad + mutual)
estimates0_coefs <- sprintf("%03.2f", coef(estimates0))
```

\pause

\vspace{1cm}

This model has **MLE parameter estimates** of `r estimates0_coefs[1]` (low density), `r estimates0_coefs[2]` (high chance of ttriads), and `r estimates0_coefs[3]` (low chance of mutuality) for the parameters `edges`, `ttriads`, and `mutual` respectively.

## Estimation of ERGMs


- Calculating of the normalizing constant in \eqref{eq:ergm}, $\kappa = \sum_{\graph'\in\GRAPH}\exp{\transpose{\params}\sufstats{\graph', \Indepvar}}$, makes ERGMs difficult to estimate.\pause

- For this reason, statistical methods have focused on avoiding the direct calculation of $\kappa$; most modern methods for estimating ERGMs rely on MCMC.


## Estimation of ERGMs (cont'd) {.t}

Description of the MCMC-MLE algorithm [@Geyer1992] \pause

1.  Make an initial guess of the model parameters $\hat\theta_0$ \pause

2.  While the algorithm doesn't converge, do: \pause
    
    a.  Generate a large sample of graphs from $\Prcond{\Graph = \graph}{\hat\theta_0, \Indepvar}$ using MCMC \pause
    
    b.  Use the simulated sample of graphs **to approximate the normalizing constant**, and so, the likelihood function. And with this approximation update the parameter $\theta_0$ using a Newton-Raphson step. \pause
    
    c.  next iteration\pause 
    
Once it converges, the last value of $\hat\theta_0$ is the MCMC-MLE estimates.\pause The variance approximation is another story.
    

---

\footnotesize

- While significant advances have been made in the area, simulation based models can suffer from \textbf{model degeneracy} [@Handcock2003].\pause

- This occurs when the model parameters \textit{live in a degenerate region}. This impacts directly the MCMC process yielding poor mixing\pause

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=.6\textheight]{handcock2003-figure5.pdf}
\caption{Model degeneracy. Figure 5 in Handcock (2003)}

- Model degeneracy is particularly problematic with small networks... (says anyone who has tried to fit one).

## ERGMs for Small Networks

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=.9\textheight]{plot-graph-4-1.pdf}
\end{figure}

## ERGMs for Small Networks (cont'd)
			
-   In the case of small networks (e.g. at most 6 nodes), the calculation of $\kappa$ becomes computationally feasible.\pause

-   This allows direct calculation of \eqref{eq:ergm}, \textbf{avoiding the need for simulations} and allowing us to obtain Maximum Likelihood Estimates using \textit{standard} optimization techniques.\pause

-   In addition, most of the time samples of small networks include multiple of them, e.g.: Families, Small teams (like our data), Ego-nets, etc.\pause

-   This makes pooled ERGM estimates a natural way of modeling the data: \pause{}

    $$
    \Prcond{\Graph_1 = \graph_1, \dots, \Graph_p = \graph_p}{\params, \Indepvar_1, \dots, \Indepvar_p} = \prod_p\frac{%
    		\exp{\transpose{\params}\sufstats{\graph_p, \Indepvar_p}}%	
    	}{
    		\kappa_p\left(\params, \Indepvar_p\right)
    	}
    $$ 

\pause

How different is this from the "normal" way to fit ERGMs?

## Estimation of ERGM\only<2->{\textcolor{USCCardinal}{ito}}s (cont'd) {.t}

Description of the \textcolor<2->{lightgray}{MCMC-}\textcolor<2->{USCCardinal}{MLE} algorithm \textcolor<2->{lightgray}{(Geyer and Thompson, 1992)}

1.  Make an initial guess of the model parameters $\hat\theta_0$

2.  While the algorithm doesn't converge, do:
    
    a.  \textcolor<2->{lightgray}{Simulate $B$ graphs from $\Prcond{\Graph = \graph}{\hat\theta_0, \Indepvar}$ using MCMC}
    
    b.  \textcolor<2->{lightgray}{Use the simulated sequence of graphs to approximate the likelihood function. And with this approximation} \textcolor<2->{USCCardinal}{update the parameter $\theta_0$ using a Newton-Raphson step}.
    
    c.  next iteration\pause\pause

By skipping the MCMC part we:\pause

1.  are able to get MLE estimates directly,\pause

2.  *avoid the degeneracy problem* latent in MCMC, and\pause

3.  obtain *more accurate* (exact) estimates *faster*. \pause

We have implemented  this and more in the `ergmito` R package

## Features of `ergmito`



This (\includegraphics[width=.1\linewidth]{lifecycle-experimental-orange.pdf}) R package has the following features\pause

- Built on top of [**statnet**](https://statnet.org)'s [`ergm`](https://github.com/statnet/ergm) R package [@hunter2008; @Handcock2018].\pause

- Allows estimating ERGMs for small networks (less than 7 and perhaps 6)[^whyupto6] via MLE.\pause

- Implements pooled ERGM models.\pause

- Includes a simulation function for efficiently drawing samples of small networks, and by **efficiently** we mean **fast**. 



[^whyupto6]: A directed graph of size 6 has a support set with $2^{6\times(6 - 1)} = 1,073,741,824$ elements.

## `ergmito` example

```{r loading-fivenets, cache=TRUE}
library(ergmito)
data(fivenets, package = "ergmito")
```

```{r plotfivenets, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, out.width='.5\\linewidth', fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
library(sna)
library(network)
op <- par(mfrow = c(2, 3), mai=rep(0, 4), oma = rep(0, 4))
USCCARDINAL <- rgb(153, 0, 0, maxColorValue = 255)
ans <- lapply(fivenets, function(f) {
  gplot(
    f,
    vertex.cex = 2,
    vertex.col = c("white", USCCARDINAL)[
      get.vertex.attribute(f, "female") + 1
    ]
    )
  })
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1))
legend("center", fill = c("white", USCCARDINAL), legend = c("Male", "Female"), cex=1, bty="n")
par(op)
```

```{r fivenets-1, cache=TRUE}
# Looking at one of the five networks
fivenets[[1]]
```

\pause How can we fit an ERGMito to this 5 networks?

## `ergmito` example (cont'd)

The same as you would do with the `ergm` package:

```{r fit-fivenets, cache=TRUE}
(model1 <- ergmito(fivenets ~ edges + nodematch("female")))
```

```{r fit-fivenets-print, results='asis', echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
texreg::texreg(model1)
# cat(gsub("#", "\\#", unclass(out), fixed=TRUE))
```

---


```{r gof-fivenets, cache=TRUE}
(gof1 <- gof_ergmito(model1))
```


---

```{r gof-fivenets-print, cache=TRUE, out.width=".7\\linewidth", fig.align='center', width=8, height=6}
plot(gof1)
```


## Simulation Study
			
			
We conducted a simulation study to explore the properties of MLE for small networks (a.k.a. ERGMito). To generate each sample of teams:\pause

1. Draw the **population parameters** from a piecewise Uniform with values in $[-4, -.1]\cup[.1, 4]$\pause

2. We will draw **groups of sizes 3 to 5**. The number of networks per group size are drawn from a Poisson distribution with parameter 10 (hence, an expected size of 30 networks per sample).\pause

3. Use the **drawn parameters** and **group sizes** to **generate random graphs** using an ERGM data generating process.\pause

We simulated 100,000 samples, each one composed of an average of 30 networks.

## Simulation Study (cont'd)

\includegraphics[width=.55\linewidth]{fig/power-02-various-sizes-3-5.pdf}
\caption{Empirical power of Pooled-ERGM estimates at various levels of effect size. As expected, power increases significantly with sample size (\# of networks per sample). Interestingly, the discovery rate of an effect size within $[1, 2)$ is very high even with a sample size of 20-30 networks. More extreme points have higher volatility due to small number of samples included.}

# Part II: Association between network structure and team performance

## Testing effects of social network structure on group performance
			
Two common approaches: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), or permutation-like tests. Both have limitations:\pause
	
- GLMs:\pause
    
    - Sample size is problematic: How costly is getting enough teams to run get a desired level of power?\pause

- Permutation-like tests:\pause
    
    - Permutation: shuffle the dependent variable and compute, for example, correlations.\pause{} \textcolor{USCCardinal}{\textbf{Which does not control for other factors in the system.}}\pause
    
    - Rewiring [see @Milo2004]: Sample networks by generating new graphs using a rewiring algorithm, usually preserving some property such as degree sequence--the observed sequence of in/out degree.\pause \textcolor{USCCardinal}{\textbf{This assumes an oversimplifying data generating process.}}\pause{} And worse, in a network of size 4, how many different networks can be observed **holding the degree sequence fixed**?

\pause BTW: Talking about Degree sequence leads directly to the now controvelsial Scale-free networks.
  
---

**"Scale-free networks are rare"**

> \Huge"\normalsize The **structural diversity of real-world networks** uncovered here presents both a puzzle and an opportunity. The strong focus in the scientific literature on **explaining and exploiting scale-free patterns has meant relatively less is known about mechanisms that produce non-scale-free structural patterns**, e.g., those with degree distributions better fitted by a log-normal. Two important directions of future work will be the **development and validation of novel mechanisms for generating more realistic degree structure in networks**, and novel statistical techniques for identifying or untangling them given empirical data\Huge"\normalsize

## An Idea

What about using ERGMs to generate null distributions?\pause

- Even for small networks, we can generate thousands of unique graphs, so sample size is not a problem.\pause

- As a difference from permutation tests:\pause
    
    - ERGMs provide a more meaningful/realistic (or comprehensive if you like) data generating process\pause
      
    - On average, sampled networks will **look like the original** graph (addressing @broido2019's comments).\pause


In principle, this would be equivalent to a revised rewiring test...

<!-- ## A semiparametric test -->

<!-- **Notation** -->

<!-- - $\Graph = \{\graph_j\}$ is a sequence of $J$ graphs that share a common data-generating-process, e.g. teams formed in a lab. -->

<!-- - Each network has node-level attributes $x \in \mathcal{X}$. -->

<!-- - A group(graph) level outcome variable, such as team performance, $Y$. -->

<!-- - Under the null, network structure and group performance are not associated, this is $Y\perp\Graph$. -->

<!-- ## An Idea (cont'd) -->

<!-- -   Ideally, we would like to build a test with the following rationale\pause -->

<!--     $$ -->
<!--     \underbrace{\Graph \perp \Depvar}_{\mbox{Null assumption}} -->
<!--     \implies \ExpectedCond{\Depvar}{\Graph = \graph} =  -->
<!--     \Expected{\Depvar} -->
<!--     $$\pause -->

<!-- -   But this is not feasible without making strong distributional assumptions.\pause -->

<!-- -   Instead, we can take a look at the joint distribution of $(\Depvar, \Graph)$ conditioning on $\Depvar$ as follows:\pause -->

<!--     \begin{align*} -->
<!--     \hphantom{\underbrace{\Graph \perp \Depvar}_{\mbox{Null hypothesis}}} -->
<!--     & \implies \ExpectedCond{s(\Graph, \Depvar)}{\Graph = \graph} =  -->
<!--     \Expected{s(\Graph, \Depvar)} \\ -->
<!--     & \implies \underbrace{\ExpectedCond{s(\Graph, \Depvar)}{\Graph = \graph, \Depvar = \depvar}}_{\mbox{Observed statistic}} =  -->
<!--     \underbrace{\ExpectedCond{s(\Graph, \Depvar)}{\Depvar = \depvar}}_{Unobserved...} -->
<!--     \end{align*}\pause -->

<!--     Under the null, we can generate approximate the distribution of $\ExpectedCond{s(\Graph, \Depvar)}{\Depvar = \depvar}$ by simulations, in particular, drawing samples of new graphs (ERGMs). -->

## Algorithm

1.  Estimate an ERGM (estimates can come from a single graph or pooled estimates). We denote the data-generating-process of this model as $\mathcal{D}: \Theta\times \mathcal{X}\mapsto \GRAPH$.\pause

2.  Calculate the value $t_0 = t(\Graph, Y)$, the observed test statistic (e.g. correlation between triads and $\depvar$).\pause

3.  Now, for $b \in \{1, \dots, B\}$ do:\pause
    
    1.  For each group $j$ in $\{1, \dots, J\}$, draw a new network $\graph_j^b\sim\mathcal{D}(\hat{\theta}, X_j)$, this new sequence is denoted $\Graph^b$\pause
    
  	2.  Using $\Graph^b$ and $Y$, calculate $t_b = t(\Graph^b, Y)$\pause
  	
  	3.  Next $b$.\pause

This will generate a null distribution for the statistic $t$, which we can use to compare against the observed statistic, $t_0$.\pause

\alert{Note} An important distinction to make is that structures that gave origin to the graph need not to be relevant for the team's performance *per se*.
					
## Illustrated example

Suppose that we have a 3 networks of sizes 4, 4, and 5 respectively. The 

\footnotesize

\def\svgwidth{.8\linewidth}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{fig/struct-test.pdf_tex}
\end{figure}

\normalsize

We can use the distribution of the sequence $\{t_1, \dots, t_B\}$ as null to compare against $t_0$

## Extended example with `fivenets`

```{r fivenets-sim-partII, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ergmito)
library(gnet)
# Loading the fivents dataset. We actually know that data generating process,
# so we use these paramaters for the model
data(fivenets, package="ergmito")

# We will generate a group level variable that is related to the proportion of
# females in the group
set.seed(52)
# y <- count_stats(fivenets ~ nodeocov("female"))
# y <- y + rnorm(nnets(fivenets))
y <- structure(c(1.01380909984854, 0.605144783941265, 4.30851530552903, 
0.954760011709497, -0.133078830968053), .Dim = c(5L, 1L), .Dimnames = list(
    NULL, "nodeocov(\"female\")"))

# Performing the struct test
f02 <- function(g, y) cor(count_stats(g ~ nodeocov("female")), y, use = "complete.obs")[1] 
test_struct <- struct_test(
  fivenets ~ edges + nodematch("female"), y = y, R=3000,
  stat = f02
  )
# mytest02

x <- count_stats(fivenets ~ nodeocov("female"))
test_ols <- summary(lm(y ~ x))
```

Going back to our `fivenets` example: \pause

- Recall that our data-generating process for $\Graph$ was an ERGMito with parameters $\left(\theta_{edges}, \theta_{\mbox{\texttt{nodematch("female")}}}\right)$.\pause

- Imagine that $\depvar_\graph = \sufstats{\graph} + \varepsilon$, with $\varepsilon\sim N(0,1)$ and $\sufstats{\graph}$ as the number of ties sent to women (`nodeicov("female")` in `ergm`)\pause

- Our test statistic $t$ is the correlation between $\depvar$ and $\sufstats{\graph}$\pause

- The data looks something like this\pause

```{r fivenets-print-partII, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
knitr::kable(data.frame(
  y = unname(y),
  `nodeicov("female")` = unname(count_stats(fivenets ~ nodeicov("female"))),
  check.rows = FALSE
), col.names = c("y", "s(g)"))
```

---

We will try to assess the presence/absence of an association between the outcome $\depvar$ and the number of ties received by women, `nodeicov("female")`, using both a linear regression model and our test\pause

-   *Our approach* Is the the observed correlation statistic $t_0 = \mbox{cor}\left(y, \sufstats{\graph}\right)$ different than as expected by chance (assuming $\graph$ follows an ERGM distribution)?\pause

-   *OLS approach* In the following model:\pause

    $$
    \depvar = \alpha + \theta^{OLS}\sufstats{\graph} + \varepsilon,\quad\varepsilon\sim N(0,1)
    $$
    is the $\theta_{OLS}$ parameter significantly different from zero?

\centering

```{r fivenets-print-results-partII, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, out.width='.7\\linewidth'}
op <- par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
hist(test_struct$t, breaks=50, col="gray", border="transparent", main = "Null distribution of t",
     xlab = "Values of t")
abline(v = test_struct$t0, col="steelblue", lwd=2, lty="dashed")
plot(y ~ x, main = "Linear regression", xlab="s(g)", ylab = "y")
abline(lm(y~x), lty="dashed", lwd=2)
par(op)
```

\caption{Comparing our method against a linear regression. Our proposed method returned a two sided p-value of `r sprintf("%05.3f", test_struct$pvalue)`, while the pvalue for the OLS coefficient was `r sprintf("%05.3f", test_ols$coefficients["x", "Pr(>|t|)"])`.}

## Concluding remarks

Exponential Random Graph Models for Small Networks:\pause

1.  Not a new thing,\pause{} what's new is the tool to do so in a smooth way.\pause

2.  Preliminary results (both from simulations and applications) look encouraging.\pause

2.  Still work to do (on the development side of things): Goodness of fit tests, better algorithms for drawing random graphs, Bayesian models \pause (because is *great* fun...), etc.\pause

3.  Can be extended to other types of ERGMs... our next target: TERGMs (Separable Exponential Random Graph Models)\pause

Test for Association between graph level outcomes and graph structures:\pause

1.  Still need to run simulation studies to explore **power** and **false discovery** rates.\pause

2.  Also on the development side of things, need to make things a bit faster and lightweight.\pause

3.  Working on a more formal statistical framework (when is it a good/bad idea to use this kind of method).
